                        Anyone aged 18 to 54 when they apply for citizenship is
                        required to take the citizenship test. This test checks
                        if you know enough about Canada and understand the
                        rights and responsibilities of being a citizen. If you
                        are 55 or older when you apply, you don’t need to take
                        the test. However, if you turn 55 while your application
                        is being processed, you may still need to take the test
                        if you were under 55 when you applied.

                        The test is based on the Discover Canada guide, which
                        explains Canadian history, values, institutions, and the
                        rights and responsibilities of citizenship. If you study
                        the guide carefully, you should be well-prepared. The
                        test includes questions about: Facts and ideas from

                        same time. If not, you will get a letter with the

                        letting you know if the judge or officer granted you
                        citizenship and when the ceremony will take place.
